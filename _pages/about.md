I am a Ph.D. candidate in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. My primary fields are labor, public and health economics. My research focuses on the drivers of US social policy and impact of social policy on children and families' health, well-being, and economic outcomes. I am a Stone PhD Scholar in Inequality and Wealth Concentration and am affiliated with The People Lab and the Government Performance Lab.

I hold a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics from the University of Oxford and a Master in Public Policy degree from the Harvard Kennedy School.  I started my career in the UK as a secondary school mathematics teacher and have provided technical assistance to several of Rhode Islandâ€™s health and human services agencies as a fellow and project leader at the Government Performance Lab.
