### Optimization or Overreaction? How Highly-Publicized Tragedies Drive Child Protection Policy
*(Job Market Paper - will be uploaded in early October)*

Do government responses to tragedy reflect optimization in the face of information or overreaction due to bias or distorted incentives? I examine this question in the context of the child protection system, which impacts one in three children in the US. Using a new dataset of maltreatment deaths constructed from full-text newspaper archives and a difference-in-differences identification strategy, I find that agencies increase their removal rates by 19% in response to a highly-publicized death. Deaths occur frequently, but agencies only react when they are highly-publicized; this suggests that agencies are not continuously optimizing but instead respond primarily to scrutiny. Most evidence is consistent with the scrutiny inducing re-optimization rather than overreaction: agencies increase removals of the highest-risk children, do not increase removals of the lowest-risk children, and injuries among the Medicaid population decrease. But tragedies also induce some mis-optimization: Black children’s removal rates rise more than White children’s even after conditioning on risk. The paper sheds light on how media can drive government policy and the consequences for citizen welfare.


### The Impact of Public Health Insurance on Child Health and Parental Labor Supply: Evidence from Arizona's CHIP Freeze

I examine the impact of a temporary freeze in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) on parental labor supply and children’s health outcomes.  In 2010, Arizona was the only state to freeze its CHIP program.  Following the freeze, families earning between 140 and 200% of the federal poverty line could no longer enroll children in public health insurance, though children who already enrolled could maintain their coverage.  This policy created a sharp decrease in public benefits available to families with newborns.  I use triple difference and regression discontinuity designs to examine the impact on parental labor supply and child health.  The freeze reduced parental earnings: the portion of families earning between 140 and 200% of the federal poverty line declined by 7pp, and the portion earning between 0 and 50 increased by the same portion.


### Stigma and Social Safety Net Participation
*(with Kelsey Pukelis and Michael Holcomb)*

We use a descriptive survey and survey experiment to assess the role of stigma as a barrier to take-up in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) and the potential for interventions to alleviate stigma and increase take-up. We hypothesize that psychological stigma costs arise when benefits participation conflicts with (1) a personal value or identity, or (2) a real or perceived social norm. The descriptive survey measures the general population’s beliefs about individuals who participate in social programs, the observability of participation, barriers and benefits associated with participation, and attitudes of others towards participants. The experiment tests the impact of three interventions on stigmatizing beliefs and interest in SNAP participation.
