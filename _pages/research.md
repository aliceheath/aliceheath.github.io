#### Government Reactions to Local News:\\Evidence From Child Protection Tragedies
*(Job Market Paper - will be uploaded in early October)*

Over 150 children die due to maltreatment every month in the US; a small portion of these deaths are covered extensively in local newspapers. This paper examines how child protection agencies, which interact with one in three US children, react to maltreatment deaths and assesses the consequences for citizen welfare. I first analyze full-text newspaper archives to construct a new dataset of publicized maltreatment deaths between 1999 and 2019. I then adapt the staggered adoption event study framework to identify the impact of the deaths on local child protection systems and child outcomes. Agencies have large reactions to highly-publicized deaths, increasing removal rates by 19%. There is no detectable reaction to less-publicized deaths, which suggests agencies are responding primarily to scrutiny rather than information. Highly-publicized deaths induce a targeted increase in removals among children with the highest predicted risk of re-maltreatment. Moreover, injuries and psychiatric hospitalizations among Medicaid recipients decrease. But Black children's removal rates rise more than White children's even conditional on risk. Government reactions therefore do not appear to be optimal, though parts of the response may be welfare-enhancing.


#### The Impact of Public Health Insurance on Child Health and Parental Labor Supply: Evidence from Arizona's CHIP Freeze

I examine the impact of a temporary freeze in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) on parental labor supply and children’s health outcomes.  In 2010, Arizona was the only state to freeze its CHIP program.  Following the freeze, families earning between 140 and 200% of the federal poverty level could no longer enroll children in public health insurance, but children already enrolled could maintain their coverage.  This policy created a sharp decrease in public benefits available to families with newborns.  I use triple difference and regression discontinuity designs to examine the impact on parental labor supply and child health.  The freeze reduced parental earnings: the portion of families earning between 140 and 200% of the federal poverty level declined by 7 percentage points, and the portion earning between 0 and 50 increased by the same amount.


#### Stigma and Social Safety Net Participation
*(with Kelsey Pukelis and Michael Holcomb)*

Stigma may prevent participation in social safety net programs and impose utility costs on individuals already receiving benefits. We use a nationally representative to assess the prevalence of stigma and its role as a barrier to take-up in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) and the potential for interventions to alleviate stigma and increase take-up. The survey measures respondents' beliefs about the observability of participation, barriers and benefits associated with participation, and attitudes towards individuals who participate in SNAP. An experimental component tests the impact of three interventions on stigmatizing beliefs and interest in SNAP participation.
