#### Optimization or Overreaction? How Highly-Publicized Tragedies Drive Child Protection Policy
*(Job Market Paper - will be uploaded in early October)*

Do government responses to tragedy reflect optimization in the face of information or overreaction due to bias or distorted incentives? I examine this question in the context of the child protection system, which impacts one in three children in the US. Using a new dataset of highly-publicized maltreatment deaths that I construct from full-text newspaper archives and a difference-in-differences identification strategy, I find that agencies increase their removal rates by 19% in response to a highly-publicized tragedy. Agencies respond less to less-publicized deaths; this suggests they are not continuously updating but instead respond primarily to scrutiny. Most evidence is consistent with scrutiny inducing re-optimization rather than overreaction: agencies increase removals of children at highest risk of re-investigation, do not increase removals of the lowest-risk children, and injuries among Medicaid recipients decrease. But tragedies also induce some mis-optimization: Black children's removal rates rise more than White children's even after conditioning on risk. The paper sheds light on how media attention can drive government decision-making and impact citizen welfare.


#### The Impact of Public Health Insurance on Child Health and Parental Labor Supply: Evidence from Arizona's CHIP Freeze

I examine the impact of a temporary freeze in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) on parental labor supply and children’s health outcomes.  In 2010, Arizona was the only state to freeze its CHIP program.  Following the freeze, families earning between 140 and 200% of the federal poverty level could no longer enroll children in public health insurance, but children already enrolled could maintain their coverage.  This policy created a sharp decrease in public benefits available to families with newborns.  I use triple difference and regression discontinuity designs to examine the impact on parental labor supply and child health.  The freeze reduced parental earnings: the portion of families earning between 140 and 200% of the federal poverty level declined by 7 percentage points, and the portion earning between 0 and 50 increased by the same amount.


#### Stigma and Social Safety Net Participation
*(with Kelsey Pukelis and Michael Holcomb)*

Stigma may prevent participation in social safety net programs and impose utility costs on individuals already receiving benefits. We use a descriptive survey and survey experiment to assess the role of stigma as a barrier to take-up in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) and the potential for interventions to alleviate stigma and increase take-up. The descriptive survey measures the general population’s attitudes and beliefs about individuals who participate in social programs, the observability of participation, barriers and benefits associated with participation, and second-order beliefs related to stigma. The experiment tests the impact of three interventions on stigmatizing beliefs and interest in SNAP participation.
